	Prominent journalist Anand Ingalagi's book El Dorado, which detailed the events at <br>
	the Kolar Gold Fields (K.G.F.) between 1951 and 2018, was banned by the Indian government,<br>
	 but a television news channel procures a copy and interviews him
	In 1951, The Government officials discovered gold ore in southern <br>
	Mysore State where on the same day, Raja Krishnappa Bairya "Rocky" was born to <br>
	a poor underage girl Shanti. Suryavardhan, a powerful crime boss and politician, <br>
	who accompanied the official has them killed and leases the land for 99 years under <br>
	the pretext of running Narachi, a limestone mine, but secretly establishes K.G.F. He had five associates: M<br>
	Rajendra Desai, who oversees the transportation of refined gold bars; Kamal, son of suryavardhan's decreased partner Bhargav, <br>
	who is adopted by Rajendra Desai after Bhargav's death; Andrews, who oversees the gold smuggling in the Western Coast of the country;<br>
	Guru Pandian, president of the in-government DYSS party; and Adheera, Suryavardhan's brother who headed the K.G.F. security.<br>
	Suryavardhan suffers a paralysis and appoints his elder son Garuda the future heir of K.G.F. Suryavardhan expected Adheera to<br>
	serve as his son's aide, but Adheera unsuccessfully attempts to assassinate Garuda. In turn, Garuda bombs Adheera's car and is<br>
	presumed dead. Suryavardhan's former associates now eye the riches of K.G.F., out of the blues, Rajendra Desai, Kamal and Andrews.
